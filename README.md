# CreionClient

Server to go with this: https://github.com/kekzdealer/CreionServer

Similar to many rogue like games, Creion is a 2D top down game where you can run around and attack while aiming with your mouse.
The main difference is that this is a RPG, so dying and starting over from scratch isn't the plan.

Creion will not work without a Creion Server to connect to, as this client only handles rendering, user input, and probably audio at some point. All of the game logic and save data is handled by the server.
